## Technologies I used

#### Framework: **Next.js**

#### Styling: **Tailwind**

#### Js Superset **TypeScript**

It's the first big project where I used all these three things together. It made the project a lot harder to complete than any of the previous ones, however, I feel like after testing all these new technologies, I'm not going back to the basics on when I won't have to ever again.

## Recipes API

Recipes I used in this project wre taken from [Low Carb Recipes API](https://rapidapi.com/dfskGT/api/low-carb-recipes) by **dfskgt**.

## Images and Icon Sources

All the images that we're not taken from an external source were made by me in [Midjounrey](https://www.midjourney.com/). All the icons I used were taken from [Hero Icons](https://heroicons.com/). For customizing and optimizing pictures and their size I used [Resize Img](https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image) and [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/).

## Design

For optimizng the page design I decided to give [Figma](https://www.figma.com) a shot. It turned out to be a great tool for a guy like me, who is constantly not fulfilled with the thing he created and eager to make more adjustments.

## Inspiration

This time I am not able to recall any of the bigger inspiration for this project. Many of the design ideas were tested and adjusted on the go.
